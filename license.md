# straightforward license

1. Should you decide to contribute to this project, you agree to any modifications and the distribution of your code inside or outside this repository.

## license forcing

1. You are allowed to force another license over this; however, this requires a CODEOWNERS file present in the root of your directory (Your github username must also be present as a codeowner). By forcing another license, anyone who decides to use your code for any reason whatsoever must agree to your license instead.
